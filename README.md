# fizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a classic programming program that a lot of <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/">programmers apparently can't do.</a>

We're going to write a function called fizzBuzz() that will behave as follows with the each rule taking precendence over all previous rules:

If we pass it a number, it will return that number.
If we pass a number that is a multiple of 3, it will return 'Fizz'.
If we pass it a number that is a multiple of 5, it will return 'Buzz'.
If we pass it a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it will return 'FizzBuzz'.
